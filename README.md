## Introduction
In this project we implement the standard Covariance method for the PCA procedure in **modern C++17**, applying it to both grayscale and RGB image compression. The computational backbone of this implementation harnesses the power of [OpenBlas][openblas-link] and [Lapacke][lapacke-link] in order to perform high-performance matrix operations and linear algebraic computations. Additionally, to further enhance performance, we utilize parallel processing through multithreading with [OpenMP][openmp-link], alongside cache memory alignment techniques and vectorization (**SIMD**) via CPU intrinsics. 

## Key Features
- Current version supports only loading images stored as binary gzipped files.
- Converting and storing compressed images as binary, PNG, JPEG or gzip.
- Fully functional PCA algorithm for grayscale and RGB images.
- The primary procedure focuses on computing the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, as detailed [here][method-link].
- Implemented flattened storage of input image to align with cache line.
- Parallel multithreaded version of fit and transform of input image (Z-normalization).
- Parallel multithreaded and vectorized computation of the covariance matrix.
- Lapacke computation of eigenvectors with [dsyev()][dsyev-link].
- Parallel projection via matrix multiplication (utilizing CBlas [dgemm()][dgemm-link] for grayscale images). For the RGB case we parallelize the matrix multiplication using OpenMP.
- Implemented parallelized inverse PCA procedure (decompression), enabling efficient reconstruction of original image data.

>[!NOTE]
> `dsyev()` operates sequentially, which may lead to significant overhead, epsecially when processing larger images.

### TODOs
- Explore matrix-free methods for an alternative PCA procedure, eliminating the need for full eigenvector calculation and the construction and storing of the covariance matrix.
- Enable the loading of images from additional formats.


## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Python => 3.10.*
- A list of Python libraries listed [here][requirements-link]

## Installation
We provide a custom [Dockerfile][dockerfile-link] that manages all required dependencies, including GCC, OpenBlas and Lapacke.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DmMeta/ParallelPCA-ImgCompressor
cd ParallelPCA-ImgCompressor
docker build -t pca:v0.4 .
``` 
>[!NOTE]
> Naming the image `pca` and tagging it as `v0.4` ensures consistency with the provided running scripts.

## Usage
By default, we provide a run [script][script-link] that compiles and executes the main driver program inside a container. You can alter the behavior of the driver program passing two environment variables `DEBUG` and `SIMD`. 
To run the script with *debug mode* and *SIMD optmizations* disabled:
```bash
DEBUG=0 SIMD=0 ./run.sh
``` 
The execution above triggers the image compression of the [lena_hd][lena-link] image, storing two images in a results folder, one before and one after the procedure takes place.
With `DEBUG=1` one should expect the runtimes of each part of the computation and the intermediate results as well as a series of images.

The following example illustrates the main functionalities of the current project:
```C++
#include "pca.hpp"

constexpr const uint16_t N_COMPONENTS = 20;

ImgMatrix<uint8_t> img {"path/to/image.bin.gz", height, width, channels, Order::ROW_MAJOR};
PCA<uint8_t> pca;
auto compressedImg = pca.performPCA(img, N_COMPONENTS);
auto decompressedImg = pca.inversePCA(compressedImg);

// save the decompressed image
decompressedImg.saveImg("path/to/decompressedImg.png", ImageFormat::PNG);
```


## Tests
Some initial tests have been implemented using the Pytest library; however, the current test coverage remains suboptimal. 
We aim to enhance our testing framework in the future to ensure better coverage and reliability of the code.

Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
cd scripts
# ensure execute permissions are granted for run_tests.sh
chmod +x run_tests.sh
./run_tests.sh
```
